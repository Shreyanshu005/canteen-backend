Device Information: Device type, operating system, unique device identifiers.
Log Data: App usage patterns, access times, pages viewed, and information related to app crashes and performance.

Service Improvement: To analyze app performance, fix technical issues, and develop new features and services.
Security and Fraud Prevention: To detect, prevent, and respond to potential fraud, abuse, or other illegal activities.

4. Sharing and Disclosure of Information
We will not sell, rent, or trade your Personal Information to third parties for monetary consideration. We share your information only in the following limited circumstances:
With Canteen Owners: When you place an order, your Name and Order Details are shared with the relevant canteen operator to enable them to fulfill your order successfully.
Service Providers: We engage third-party service providers who perform functions on our behalf. This includes Cloud Hosting (for data storage), Analytics Services (using anonymized data), and Payment Processors. These parties are bound by contractual obligations to keep Personal Information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.
Legal Compliance: We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.
Third-Party Payment Processors
All payment processing is handled by secure third-party payment processors. We do not store or process your financial payment information. Your transaction data is subject to the privacy policy of the respective payment processor, and we encourage you to review their policies.

5. Data Security and Retention
We implement industry-standard security measures, including data encryption during transmission (HTTPS), secure server storage, and access controls, to protect your information from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, no electronic transmission or storage method is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
We retain your Personal Information for as long as your account is active. Upon account deletion, we remove your personal information immediately. We may retain anonymized usage data and transaction records for business records and legal compliance as permitted by law.

6. International Data Transfers
BunkBite operates globally, with core operations in India. Your information may be transferred to and processed in India or other countries where our service providers maintain facilities. By using the App, you consent to this transfer. We ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your data during these transfers.
